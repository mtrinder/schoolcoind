# MaxCoin Example Config

# maxcoin.conf configuration file. Lines beginning with # are comments.

# When configuring maxcoin via this configuration file, the file must
# be placed in the following folder with the following name for the 
# appropriate operating system (note: the folder may be hidden, so it
# is important to unhide hidden folders):
#
#   Linux - /home/<username>/.maxcoin/maxcoin.conf
#   Windows - C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\MaxCoin\maxcoin.conf
#   OSX - /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/MaxCoin/maxcoin.conf

# Connect via a SOCKS proxy
#proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

# Bind to given address and always listen on it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6.
#bind=<addr>

# Use as many addnode= settings as you like to connect to specific peers.
#addnode=dnsseed.maxcoinhub.io:8668
#addnode=dnsseed.maxcoin.org.uk:8668

# Alternatively use as many connect= settings as you like to connect ONLY to specific peers.
#connect=dnsseed.maxcoinhub.io:8668

# JSON-RPC options (for controlling a running Maxcoin-Qt/maxcoind process)
#

# server=1 tells Maxcoin-Qt to accept JSON-RPC commands.
#server=0

# On client-side, you add the normal user/password pair to send commands.
#rpcuser=madmax
#rpcpassword=DONT_USE_THIS_YOU_WILL_GET_ROBBED_8ak1gI25KFTvjovL3gAM967mies3E=

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed.  Specify
# as many rpcallowip= settings as you like to allow connections from
# other hosts, either as a single IPv4/IPv6 or with a subnet specification.
#rpcallowip=10.1.1.34
#rpcallowip=192.168.1.*

# NOTE: opening up the RPC port to hosts outside your local trusted network is 
# NOT RECOMMENDED, because the rpcpassword is transmitted over the network unencrypted.

# server=1 tells Maxcoin-Qt to accept JSON-RPC commands.
# it is also read by maxcoind to determine if RPC should be enabled

# Miscellaneous options
#

# Mining is initially disabled.
